# Usage

## Getting started

Generate an access token [in the CompanyCam app](https://app.companycam.com/access_tokens)
and create an API object using your access token:

```python
>>> import companycam
>>> api = companycam.API(token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")
```

## Advanced

You can make authorized calls to the API directly using the HTTPX client generated by
the API object.

For example, to make a `GET` request to `/`:
```python
>>> with api.client.make_client() as client:
>>>     request = client.build_request("GET", "/")
>>>     response = client.send(request)
```
