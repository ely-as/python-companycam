"""
These exceptions are HTTP status errors which have been mapped to CompanyCam error
types, so they can handled semantically e.g.

```py
try:
    api.projects.list()
except companycam.PaymentRequired as exc:
    ...
except companycam.Forbidden as exc:
    ...
```

The class names, status codes and docstrings used for subclasses of
`BaseCompanyCamException` are based on: https://docs.companycam.com/reference/codes.
